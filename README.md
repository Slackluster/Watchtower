**Watchtower** lets you keep a watchful eye on quests, tasks, currency, and more. It includes a fully customizable status tracker that lets you:
- Track daily/weekly quest completion
- Track if you've done your garrison invasion this week
- Track if you've killed Rukhmar this week
- Track if you are in Chromie Time or War Mode
- Track when you have enough Honor to exchange for Marks of Honor
- Track if you have the Mentor role
- Track whatever you want, so long as the game can provide the information!

This addon is meant to be a soft replacement for non-combat WeakAuras and is intended to include more features over time to be able to do so.
